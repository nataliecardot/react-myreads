MyReads
======

This app, built using React as a project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program, allows for sorting books into "currently reading," "want to read," and "read" categories as well as searching for books using a limited set of search terms that are listed in _SEARCH_TERMS.md_.


### Get Started

**[View it live](http://nataliecardot.com/react-myreads)**

**View locally:**
To launch the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Using a command line tool, navigate to the directory's location
3. Run `npm install`, which installs all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server, opening the app in your default browser. (The command causes node to look for a scripts object in your package.json file, which in this case specifies "react-scripts start.")


### Dependencies and Acknowledgements

The app was built using [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) and a backend API provided by Udacity.

The starter code was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which installs the packages `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-scripts`. Additionally, `react-scripts` installs Babel, webpack, and `webpack-dev-server`, which provides auto-reload behavior.

Routing is performed with [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route).

Props are typechecked using [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html).
